# TAP-Net: Transport-and-Pack using Reinforcement Learning

![overview](./doc/overview.png)


## Introduction

We introduce the transport-and-pack(TAP) problem, a frequently encountered instance of real-world packing, and develop a neural optimization solution based on reinforcement learning. 
Given an initial spatial configuration of boxes, we seek an efficient method to iteratively transport and pack the boxes compactly into a target container. Due to obstruction and accessibility constraints, our problem has to add a new search dimension, i.e., finding an optimal em transport sequence, to the already immense search space for packing alone. Using a learning-based approach, a trained network can learn and encode solution patterns to guide the solution of new problem instances instead of executing an expensive online search. In our work, we represent the transport constraints using a precedence graph and train a neural network, coined TAP-Net, using reinforcement learning to reward efficient and stable packing.

        --valid_size=10 \
        --train_size=1280 \
        --epoch_num=200 \
        --dataset=RAND \
        --packing_strategy=LB_GREEDY \
        \
        --nodes=10 \

This command means you want to train the network in **2D** condition, using the **RAND** dataset, the training data size is **1280**, the task is packing **10** blocks into a container, the initial container size is **7** x inf, the target container size is **5** x inf, reward type is **C+P+S-lb-soft**.

Then it will generate a folder unber `pack/` folder to store the training or testing result.
The folder structure of `pack` looks like this:

    pack/
        10/  <--- nodes=10
            2d-bot-C+P+S-lb-soft-LB_GREEDY-width-5-note-*some-useless-words*-2020-09-02-14-0/ <--- the folder create by our code
                checkpoints/    <--- store models of each epoch
                    0/          <--- the epoch num
                    1/
                    ...
                render/         <--- store the testing result of each epoch
                    0/  
                    1/
                    ...

The `data/` folder contain the training and testing data, the folder structure of `pack` looks like this:

    data/
        rand_2d/
            pack-train-10-1280-7-1-5/
                blocks.txt      <--- blocks data, container each rotation type
                pos.txt         <--- blocks' positons in initial container
                dep_move.txt    <--- movement dependency
                dep_large.txt   <--- rotation dependency (left/forward)
                dep_small.txt   <--- rotation dependency (right/backward)
                container.txt   <--- only use in multi-target container task, just some random generated target container id for blocks

Under these folders, we have many kinds for dataset, `pack-train-10-1280-7-1-5` means the training dataset with 1280 data, each data has 10 blocks, the initial container width is 7, the block size is from 1\~5. `pack-valid-6-100-5-1-4` means the testing dataset with 100 data, each data has 6 blocks, the initial container width is 5, the block size is from 1\~4.
